# Longest-Word-Length
This JavaScript code defines an arrow function named 'test2' that takes a string 'chain' as input. It splits the string into an array of words using the space character as a delimiter, then uses the 'map' function to create an array containing the length of each word. Finally, it returns the length of the longest word using 'Math.max'.
