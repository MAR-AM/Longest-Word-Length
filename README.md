# Longest-Word-Length
This JavaScript code defines an arrow function named 'test2' that takes a string 'chain' as input. It splits the string into an array of words using the space character as a delimiter, then uses the 'map' function to create an array containing the length of each word. Finally, it returns the length of the longest word using 'Math.max'.
The script prompts the user to enter a string 'chain'. It then calls the 'test2' function with 'chain' as an argument and attempts to output the result using 'document.write'. However, the function is missing a 'return' statement, causing it to return 'undefined'. To fix this, you can add 'return' before 'Math.max'.
